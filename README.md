# UTS-DSI-x-Disability-Research-Network
This repository contains work conducted in collaboration with the Data Science Institute (DSI) and Disability Research Network (DRN) at the University of Technology, Sydney. 

The project involves preprocessing textual data from the Royal Commission into "Aged Care Quality and Safety", and "Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability". Initial attempts were made to create a document-fetching algorithm designed to minimise the amount of time a user spends searching legal documentation and therefore be able to find information sooner.

Our research spans various implementations of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on this data, as well as utilising common deep-learning algorithms such as BERT and GPT-3. Most of our work is showcased in this repository for you to browse, as well as understand both the advantages and drawbacks on the application of such algorithms in this particular use case.

We hope with further reserarch and development that this will benefit not only legal professionals, but also the general public in being able to access this information more efficiently.

A warm thank you to Adam Berry and Linda Steel who co-supervised this topic area of research, and who have also given permission to make these findings publicly available.
