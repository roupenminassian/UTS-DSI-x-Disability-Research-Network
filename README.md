# UTS-DSI-x-Disability-Research-Network
This repository contains work conducted with the Data Science Institute and Disability Research Network at the University of Technology, Sydney. The project involves preprocessing textual data from the Royal Commission into "Aged Care Quality and Safety", and "Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability". The project attempt to create a document-fetching system designed to minimise the amount of time a user spends searching legal documentation - with the aim of ultimately creating a question-answering system for legal professionals, as well as the general public.  This project was co-supervised by Adam Berry and Linda Steel.
